    <string name="guide_description">The area along the river was long inhabited by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, who relied on the river for fish, water and transportation. The site of Augusta was used by Native Americans as a place to cross the Savannah River, because of its location on the fall line.  In 1735, two years after James Oglethorpe founded Savannah, he sent a detachment of troops to explore the upper Savannah River. He gave them an order to build at the head of the navigable part of the river. The expedition was led by Noble Jones, who created the settlement to provide a first line of defense for coastal areas against potential Spanish or French invasion from the interior. Oglethorpe named the town Augusta, in honor of Princess Augusta, wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales (she was the mother of King George III of the United Kingdom). Oglethorpe visited Augusta once, in September 1739. He did so while returning to Savannah from a perilous visit to Coweta Town, where he had met with a convention of 7,000 Native American warriors and concluded peaceful relations with several Native American groups in what is today the northern and western part of Georgia.[8] Augusta was the second state capital of Georgia from 1785 until 1795 (alternating for a period with Savannah, the first).  Augusta developed rapidly as a market town as the Black Belt in the Piedmont was developed for cotton cultivation. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of short-staple cotton profitable, and this type of cotton was well-suited to the upland areas. Cotton plantations were worked by slave labor, with hundreds of thousands of slaves shipped from the Upper South to the Deep South in the domestic slave trade. Many of the slaves were brought from the Lowcountry, where their Gullah culture had developed on the large Sea Island cotton and rice plantations  As a major city in the area, Augusta was a center of activities during Reconstruction and after. In the mid-20th century, it was a site of civil rights demonstrations. In 1970 Charles Oatman, a mentally disabled teenager, was killed by his cellmates in an Augusta jail. A protest against his death broke out in a riot involving 500 people, after six black men were killed by police,[9] each found to have been shot in the back.[10] The noted singer and entertainer James Brown was called in to help quell lingering tensions, which he succeeded in doing.[9]</string>
